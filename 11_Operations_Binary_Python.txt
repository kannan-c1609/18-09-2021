"""

Problem Description :
The Binary number system only uses two digits, 0 and number system can be called binary string. You are required to implement the following function:
intOperationsBinaryString(char* str);
The function accepts a string str as its argument. The string str consists of binary digits eparated with an alphabet as follows:
•	– A denotes AND operation
•	– B denotes OR operation
•	– C denotes XOR Operation
You are required to calculate the result of the string str, scanning the string to right taking one opearation at a time, and return the same.
Note:
•	No order of priorities of operations is required
•	Length of str is odd
•	If str is NULL or None (in case of Python), return -1
Input:
str: 1C0C1C1A0B1
Output:
1
